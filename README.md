GitHub Actions : [![Build Status](https://github.com/PsuAstro528/project-template/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PsuAstro528/project-template/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amain)


## Project Goals:  
- Put software development skills learned during class and lab exercises into practice on a real world problem
- Gain experience optimizing real scientific code
- Gain experience parallelizing a real scientific code 
- Investigate how performance scales with problem size and number of processors
- Share lessons learned with the class

Prior to the [peer code review](https://psuastro528.github.io/Fall2023/project/code_reviews/), update this readme, so as to make it easy for your peer code reviewer to be helpful.  What should they know before starting the review?  Where should they look first?  

Remember to commit often and push your repository to GitHub prior to each project deadline.
